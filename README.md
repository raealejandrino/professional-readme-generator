# README Generator

## The Repository

This repository is where I (Rae Alejandrino) write and implement a working README generator using node.js

In this repository, you'll find all the files neccesary to run a fully functioning README generator! Upon running the application, you'll be prompted to enter information about your project to output an organized and structured README markdown file.
